# DSCL-EXP-AND-Bitwise-operator
Short Description: This C program takes two integer inputs from the user, performs a bitwise AND operation on them, and then prints the result.

Algorithm:

Declare two integer variables x and y. Prompt the user to input the value of x. Read the value of x from the user using the scanf function. Prompt the user to input the value of y. Read the value of y from the user using the scanf function. Perform a bitwise AND operation on x and y using the & operator. Print the result of the operation using the printf function and the %d format specifier. Output: When this program is executed, it will prompt the user to input two integer values. After the user inputs the values, the program will perform a bitwise AND operation on them and print the result. For example, if the user inputs 10 for x and 15 for y, the program will output:

Output = 10
